## 🛠️ Key Features
- **MVC Architecture:** Core structural pattern for organized application components: Model, View, Controller.
- **Observer Pattern:** Ensures real-time reflection of model changes in the view.
- **Factory Pattern:** Offers flexibility in object creation without specifying the exact class.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Allows choosing different algorithms or processes in the application's modules.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
- Compile using Maven with JAR.
- Compile through the terminal.

## 🚀 Usage
To utilize the Youtube Control Panel, follow these simple steps:

1. **Input a YouTube Video URL:** Start by entering the URL of a YouTube video.
2. **View Recent Videos:** The panel will display the 5 most recent videos from the associated YouTube channel.
3. **Select a Video:** Choose one of the displayed videos for detailed analysis.
4. **Analyze Video Data:** View various data points such as likes, views, and comments represented through different types of graphs.

This interactive approach provides a hands-on experience in YouTube data visualization and analysis.
