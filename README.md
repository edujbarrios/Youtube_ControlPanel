## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the Youtube Control Panel project! This Java-based application is an advanced implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, encapsulating various other design patterns like Observer, Factory, State, and Strategy to enhance functionality and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **MVC Architecture:** Serves as the core structural pattern, organizing the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller, to display some information in certain graphs.
- **Observer Pattern:** Implemented to ensure that changes in the model are consistently reflected in the view, enhancing the reactive nature of the application.
- **Factory Pattern:** Utilized for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created, allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance while creating the graphs.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Employed to enable a choice of algorithms or processes within the application's modules, promoting modularity and testability, while fetching the data.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
